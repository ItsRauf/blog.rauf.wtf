Web Development is a hobby I partake in on a daily basis. Whether it be plain HTML, CSS, and JS or a more complex project using tools like Webpack, Typescript, React, etc. I love to work using the web. Web Development for me has to be enjoyable, which means using my favourite languages and tools.

## The Perfect Setup:

- ## [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)

  ![snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/img/social-2.jpg)
  "Snowpack is a lightning-fast frontend build tool, designed for the modern web." ([https://www.snowpack.dev/](https://www.snowpack.dev/))

  Snowpack for me is the best build tool I've used. As its website says "Once you try it, it's impossible to go back to anything else." ([https://www.snowpack.dev/](https://www.snowpack.dev/))

  With its fast builds, module caching, and support for my favourites, it easily became my favourite build tool.

- ## [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

  "Fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API" ([https://preactjs.com/](https://preactjs.com/))

  Preact over React wasn't a simple choice for me. As someone who started with plain HTML, the React JSX syntax is right at home. However, Preact provides everything React can but at a lighter weight which is much more favourable to me.

- ## [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

  ![typescript](https://spencerjones.blog/image/posts/typescript.jpeg)
  "Typed JavaScript at Any Scale." ([https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/))

  Why Typescript over Javascript? The choice just made sense. Typescript is everything Javascript is, but strongly typed which lets me catch errors before end users are able to.

- ## [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

  ![tailwind](https://www.jens.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tailwind.jpg)

  "Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML." ([https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/))

  Tailwind to me is perfect. With its utility-first approach, it allows me to transport layouts from design tools like Figma and Photoshop over to HTML without having to do the heavy lifting of manually having to write out all the CSS

And that's my perfect setup. It works wonders for me and speeds up my workflow immensely.
